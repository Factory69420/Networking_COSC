1. Tunnels Training - Local Practice


T3 is the authorized initial pivot

Conduct passive recon on the Target T3, it appears to have access to the 10.3.0.0/24 subnet.

    Create a Local Port Forward from your Internet_Host to T3 targeting:

ip: 10.3.0.27
port: `HTTP``

Identify the flag on Victoria's HTTP Server


Step one get into pivot


bluehost1:

ssh net1_student6@10.50.20.51 


Step two creater forwarder

bluehos2t:
ssh net1_student6@10.50.20.51 -L 10699:10.3.0.27:80 -NT


step tgree wget with loopback ip on port we specified 
Check ips to ports:
ss -ntlp


wget -r http://127.0.0.1:10699
cd to directory made
mimeopen index.html


You have accessed Victoria's HTTP server. The flag is: We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat. They do not exist. 



2. Tunnels Training - Dynamic Practice
T3 is the authorized initial pivot

Conduct passive recon on the Target T3, it appears to have access to the 10.3.0.0/24 subnet.

    Create a Dynamic Port Forward from Internet_Host to T3 then use proxychains to pull the flag.

Target ip: 10.3.0.1

Identify the flag on Cortina's FTP Server



bluehost1:
ssh net1_student6@10.50.20.51 -D 9050 -NT


bluehost2:
proxychains wget -r ftp://10.3.0.1


bluehost2:
cd 10.3.0.1   
cat flag.txt

You have accessed Cortina's FTP server. The flag is "If I'm not back in five minutes, just wait longer!"



3. Tunnels Training - Compromised

Access to T4 has been provided via telnet.

This is a Compromised host within Donovia

Leverage this internal access to act as an insider threat throughout this Grorgan Cyber Training Operation.

Conduct passive recon on this host and determine where the shared location for data relating to CCTC is on the machine.

from bluehost to get to T4:
 telnet 10.50.24.9
net1_student6
password6

T4:
find / -name flag* 2> /dev/null

cat /usr/share/cctc/flag.txt

You have accessed Jose's shared folder where he saves information. Your flag is: Star Wars!








4. Tunnels Training - Remote Practice


T3 is the authorized initial pivot

Conduct passive recon on the Target T4, it appears to have access to the 10.2.0.0/25 subnet.

    Create a Remote Port Forward from T4 to T3 binding the source as one of Your authorized ports, from the Mission Prompt, targeting:

ip: 10.2.0.2 port: HTTP

    Create a Local Port Forward from Internet_Host to T3 targeting the port you just established.

When creating tunnels your authorized port ranges to utilize are NssXX (N = Net number, ss = Student Number and XX = is student assigned port number)

    Use curl or wget to pull the flag.

Identify the flag on Mohammed Web Server


TELNET TO T4:
ssh -R 10688:localhost:22 net1_student6@10.3.0.10 -NT



bluehost1:

ssh net1_student6@10.50.20.51 -L 10687:localhost:10688 -NT

bluehost2:

ssh net1_student6@localhost -p 10687 -L 10686:10.2.0.2:80 -NT




bluehost3:

wget -r http://localhost:10686

cd localhost\:10686/

mimeopen index.html 


You have accessed Mohammed's HTTP server. The flag is: Millennium Falcon!
