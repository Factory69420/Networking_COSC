dos


24. Attack Analysis - Type of Attack 2


Is this an automated attack? (yes/no)

Once you have completed challenge questions 1 - 24 you can shorten the pcap to make Wireshark run faster.

First run this filter to select everything but the flooding of UDP port 55.

!(udp.port==55)

Next export the selected packets as a new pcap using File > Export Specified Packets.

Save as a new pcap and load it in Wireshark. You should now only have 86345 packets instead of the 1.9 million you had before.
