2. Attack Analysis - IP's


Determine all IP addresses that were captured in the pcap, and list them in order. You should find 10.

Example:

1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3


91.189.89.199,192.168.10.101,192.168.10.111,192.168.10.112,192.168.41.1,192.168.41.2,192.168.41.130,192.168.41.254,224.0.0.251,239.255.255.250




3. Attack Analysis - Hosts

How many hosts are in the capture?

8 because 2 of the ips in endpoints are private idk why





4. Attack Analysis - OSI Layer




What Transport Layer Protocol is the most prominent in the capture?


udp

just guessed between that and tcp






5. Attack Analysis - OS Type

p0f has extensive finger printing capabilities (as indicated by the name).

Use p0f to read the pcap and determine the OS type of the host: 192.168.10.101



sudo p0f -r attack_analysis1.pcap -o 192.168.10.101


Linux 3.11 


6. Attack Analysis - Cellular

There is traffic related to 2G & 3G Cellular Communications, which uses a packet oriented mobile data standard.

What standard/protocol is performing this communication?
be sure to name the protocol and not the standard being used!


Just used chatgpt

GPRS


7. Attack Analysis - Address 1 - Types

Within the packet capture, the following IP Address was identified:

239.x.x.x

What type of address is this?
