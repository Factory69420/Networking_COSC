Using Best Tunneling practices:

    Build a Dynamic (-D) Tunnel to each system so that you can run your tools using proxychains to enumerate and interact with internal services.
    Use Local (-L) and Remote (-R) tunnels where appropriate to delve deeper into the network.
    Write out your commands on a piece of paper or a text editor and be ready to go over this as a class.





Tunnels Practice

    Entry Float IP: 10.50.24.91

        Your Network Number is N (Given by Instructor)

        Credentials: net{N}_studentX:passwordX

        X is your student number

    Task 3 - Donovian Tunnels Training: dig_dug_dig_dug

        Your Network Number is N (Given by Instructor)

        Credentials: net{N}_studentX:passwordX

        X is your student number

        T3 (Atropia) Float IP address is - 10.50.20.51

        T4 (Pineland) Float IP address is - 10.50.24.9 (Note - You can only telnet here to act as an insider, this will not be a routed path)







ssh net1_student19@10.50.24.91
