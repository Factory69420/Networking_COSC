Using Best Tunneling practices:

    Build a Dynamic (-D) Tunnel to each system so that you can run your tools using proxychains to enumerate and interact with internal services.
    Use Local (-L) and Remote (-R) tunnels where appropriate to delve deeper into the network.
    Write out your commands on a piece of paper or a text editor and be ready to go over this as a class.
